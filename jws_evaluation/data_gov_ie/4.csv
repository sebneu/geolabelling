Interesting and unusual Sheela-na-gig which is carved in relief on the underside of a large hammer dressed limestone corbel (0.3m x 0.24m x 0.42m). The figure consists of a poorly preserved pear shaped face which is carved on the upward sloping part of the corbel with a small round body with bow shaped arms pulling vulva apart, which is represented by a small circular hole. There are two small circular breasts one between each arm. The head is the dominant part of the figure being carved in high relief and placed on the most visible part of the corbel. The rest of the body is carved in lower relief and is placed on the lower underside of the corbel. May have originally come from the medieval church (OF035-012001-) in the town of Birr. Described by Freitag as a ?figure carved on curved underside of oblong stone (dims. H -0.53m; Wth 0.3m) which might be a broken-off corbel; quite weathered. Large (now) featureless head on elongated thick neck. Thin bent arms with small round breasts under armpits. Both well shaped hands in front of body, pointing to vulva whose irregular shape looks torn. Lower part of sculpture appears to have been deliberately damaged. Legs no longer traceable?

It is described by Freitag (2004, 129) as a figure ?carved on a rectangular slab; the figure was given a patent reveal surrounding it when it was inserted in the new parapet.
